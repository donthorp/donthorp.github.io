I had a big scare the other day. We went to my daughter's<br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.donthorp.net&#47;gallery&#47;allibridging">Brownie Bridging Ceremony<&#47;a><br />
where I took several once in a lifetime photos. While we were at the ceremony, we reviewed<br />
the photos many times and everything look great.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
When I got home, I started to pull the images from the CF card and noticed that<br />
there were no photos! The card showed that it had almost 57MB used, but the<br />
directory must have been corrupted.  So that I wouldn't mess things up, I left<br />
the card alone.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
After a few hours, I did a google search and found this gem:<br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;home.arcor.de&#47;christian_grau&#47;dir&#47;index.html" target="blank">Digital Image Recovery<&#47;a>.<br />
Not only is this tool free, it was able to pull the images off the CF card.  If you<br />
run into a similar problem, try this tool. It doesn't do any writes to the card so<br />
it is pretty safe. I keep saying card, but the software works with any device<br />
that can be mounted as a drive.<br />
