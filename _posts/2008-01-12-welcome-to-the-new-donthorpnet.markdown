<p>It took quite a while to get all the pieces put together, mostly because I couldn't figure out how to disable the new canonical URL stuff in Wordpress. Once I located the section of code to comment out, it started coming together pretty rapidly. As part of the conversion process, I also had to upgrade <a href="http:&#47;&#47;gallery.menalto.com&#47;" target="_blank">Gallery<&#47;a> to Gallery2.</p>
<p>The impetus for the rewrite was a desire to aggregate all of my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Flotsam">flotsam and jetsam<&#47;a>.  I wanted to hopefully drive more traffic to the site so that I can generate a small amount of revenue from ads, books, etc. At a minimum, it'll help offset the cost of my toys.</p>
<p>What I've discovered is that it's pretty easy to start pulling in the bits and pieces from Twitter, Magnolia, LibraryThing, et al. to make a semi-coherent website using the best of breed tools sprinkled around the net.</p>
<p>I'm keeping <a href="http:&#47;&#47;v1.donthorp.net">www.donthorp.net - Version 1<&#47;a> up and running for the time being, as well as my blog on wordpress <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.donthorp.net">blog.donthorp.net<&#47;a>. </p>
