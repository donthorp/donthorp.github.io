<p>Ages and ages ago some friends and I were able to get the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lol.com">lol.com<&#47;a> domain and have kept it all these years. A couple of years ago, when advertising started coming back, my business partner <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.johnmunsch.com">John Munsch<&#47;a> and I started talking about how we could make it more than just a dead site and an email trap.</p>
<p>A little over a year ago, we brought up a very simple site with a very limited set of jokes. We opened up a gmail account to accept jokes to place on the site, but it was too hard to keep up with the submissions, format them all, and get them live on the site. After the site had been up for a while, it became apparent that there was growth potential and it was worth getting an interactive site up and running.</p>
<p>So for the last year or so John and I have been working to bring our initial vision to life. John has done most of the development for this site, I've done most of the IT. We have released version 2.0 of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.lol.com">LOL<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>We're proud of our baby. If you have some time stop by and give it a look.</p>
