<p>Every once in a while I hop on that rabbit trail known as "the net". Today's trail started on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;donthorp">twitter<&#47;a>. Seeing that I'm a fan of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;geekbrief.tv">Cali Lewis on GeekBrief.tv<&#47;a>,   I wondered who she follows. Nosing around, I decided that maybe I should add some more people to follow.</p>
<p>On a whim I put "trader" in the search box, a couple of squirrel revolutions later, and out pops <a href="https:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;tw&#47;search&#47;users?q=trade">a list<&#47;a> with a name I couldn't pass up -- <a href="https:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;TradingGoddess">TradingGoddess<&#47;a>. Jump to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;tradinggoddess.blogspot.com&#47;">her blog<&#47;a>, spin the mouse wheel and out pops the gem below.</p>
