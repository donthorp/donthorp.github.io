  content: "Don-\r\nThanks for being a good sport. I know a lot of people hate Memes
    (ie, Frizzlefry), but I thought mine was fun. I looked for people who hadn't been
    tagged, or hadn't been tagged recently. I thought it'd be a fun way to get to
    know a tad more than we already know.  I also love the people you tagged, cant
    wait to see the results.  Oh, and let's hear it about the hair!\r\n\r\nMatt"

<p>So my Twitter bud <a href="http:&#47;&#47;babblingaboutnothing.com&#47;" target="_blank">Matt<&#47;a> aka <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;mmWine" target="_blank">mmWine<&#47;a>, using his best evil laugh, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;babblingaboutnothing.com&#47;?p=83" target="_blank">meme tagged<&#47;a> me for "Six Random Facts About Me". Looking around the Net I see that this meme has been running around for a while and has stayed basically true to form. The main deviation is changing the number of <b>random facts<&#47;b>. Since I wanted to be able to get some sleep tonight, I'm very thankful that Matt is passing on the six facts meme and not the 8 facts meme.</p>
<h2>Random Facts<&#47;h2></p>
<p>Let's consult "The Book of Don". </p>
<h3>Random Fact #1<&#47;h3></p>
<p>As a kid, I usually minded pretty well, but in this case I "bent" the rules a bit. We lived on a ranch in Missouri that had several ponds. One day as I was heading out for some reason mom told me to not get wet. Not sure how she knew I was considering going swimming in the pond, but she must have had an idea. But, I really wanted to see what it was like to swim in early April after the ice had thawed. Solution: Skinny dippin and  for the record it was cold, not too bad, but it also gave me the ability to sympathize with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;George_Costanza" target="_blank">George Constanza<&#47;a> years later. Oh and I returned home safe and dry.</p>
<h3>Random Fact #2<&#47;h3><br />
Growing up on a ranch you also need certain skills, one of which is artificially breeding cattle. It's one of those skills that I don't think one can ever forget.</p>
<h3>Random Fact #3<&#47;h3></p>
<p>Laura and I got engaged after our third date. She lived in Amarillo at the time and I was still going to school at TCU. She had graduated a little earlier from TCU. Neither of us knew the other while we were at TCU. So three dates in less than a month and we're engaged. I can still remember us telling her parents as we were putting up the Christmas tree. First words out of her father's mouth ... "Are you pregnant". </p>
<p>It's worked out pretty well, we just had our 21st anniversary.</p>
<h3>Random Fact #4<&#47;h3></p>
<p>I've worked on many different projects over the years but three consumer items that I worked on were.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;store.vintagepaperads.com&#47;servlet&#47;-strse-8908&#47;1993-Tandy-Sensation-Computer&#47;Detail" target="_blank">Tandy Sensation<&#47;a> the first Windows multimedia PC. Some one even put up a video of an <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=h3U7DFUqoVM&feature=related" target="_blank">old commercial<&#47;a><&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Tandy_Video_Information_System" target="_blank">Tandy VIS<&#47;a> a horribly flawed device that we actually made sort of work, but it failed miserably.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.pcworld.com&#47;article&#47;126692-3&#47;the_25_greatest_pcs_of_all_time.html" target="_blank">Gateway Destination PC<&#47;a> item #20 towards the bottom of the page. First real attempt to have a converged device in the Den.<br />
<&#47;ol></p>
<h3>Random Fact #5<&#47;h3></p>
<p>I've been growing my hair out for over 18 months. The story of which will appear in an upcoming blog post. In the spirit of baring oneself, most of the hair is on the sides and back; Not so much contributed from the top of my scalp.</p>
<h3>Random Fact #6<&#47;h3></p>
<p>Self-funded (read really similar to starving college days) Select Payment Processing, with some friends. It was successfully sold years later.</p>

<h2>The Rules<&#47;h2></p>
<p>The rules to play are easy &hellip;<br />
1. Link to the person who tagged you. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;babblingaboutnothing.com&#47;?p=83" target="_blank">Matt Tagged me here<&#47;a>.<br />
2. Post the rules on the blog.<br />
3. Write six random things about yourself.<br />
4. Tag six people at the end of your post.<br />
5. Let each person know they have been tagged.<br />
6. Let the tagger know when your entry is up.</p>
<p>I look forward to learning about y&rsquo;all. Tag, you&rsquo;re it!</p>
