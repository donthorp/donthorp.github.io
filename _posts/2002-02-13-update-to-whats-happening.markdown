<p>
                    As you can tell from the time difference between now and the last<br />
                    entry, I've been busy.<br />
                <&#47;p></p>
<p>
                    The other problem is the effort it takes to update the site. I'm<br />
                    considering using <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.moveabletype.org" target="_blank"><br />
                    Moveable Type<&#47;a> for web log entries. John has been using it for a while,<br />
                    and it seemed to make it easier for him to add updates. If I can wade<br />
                    through the documentation and figure out how to convert my information<br />
                    easily, I'll probably do it to.<br />
                <&#47;p></p>
