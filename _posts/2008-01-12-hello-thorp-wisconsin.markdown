    there is a group to check out called  "Yeah, I''ve been to Thorp Wisconsin: The
    Redo".  Even though you have never been here we would love for you to join the
    group because after all you are a Thorp.  Hope to see you there.'

<p>Imagine my surprise when a slip of a google search turns up a town with my surname, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Thorp,_Wisconsin" target="_blank">Thorp, Wisconsin<&#47;a>. My earlier years were spent in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Sarcoxie%2C_Missouri" target="_blank">Sarcoxie, Missouri<&#47;a> (pop 1280, back then). The population of Thorp is 1536, from the last census numbers. I'm guessing with a well timed Google street view, you might be able to see everyone in town.</p>
<p>Visiting the cities' website (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cityofthorp.com&#47;" target="_blank">http:&#47;&#47;www.cityofthorp.com&#47;<&#47;a>) it looks to be a nice place with lots of civic activities and nice public facilities. Here is a brief <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cityofthorp.com&#47;cityofthorp&#47;history+of+thorp&#47;default.asp" target="_blank">history<&#47;a> of the town which was founded in 1893.</p>
<p>Thanks <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com">Google<&#47;a> for bringing me some fun information.</p>
