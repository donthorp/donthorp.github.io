					Believe it or not, the lack of updates does not signal my demise. Life has<br />
					been really hectic lately and getting updates to the website has just been<br />
					close to impossible.<br />
				<&#47;p></p>
<p>
					I have ton of resource links that I need to get added, but I'm going to<br />
					hold off for a little while, until John finished is experiment with OPML.<br />
					I already keep my resource list in xml form, but I'm open to using a standard<br />
					that has tools available.<br />
				<&#47;p></p>
<h3>XML-RPC<&#47;h3></p>
<p>
					Today I was reading on Meerkat and found an interesting topic on using<br />
					XML-RPC to manage your weblog on Blogger and another product called<br />
					<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.free-conversant.com&#47;" target="_blank">Free Conversant<&#47;a>.<br />
					I haven't read through it, but first glance seems to indicate that it comes<br />
					in a open form that we could run on our own servers.<br />
				<&#47;p></p>
<p>
					I also happened upon <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.stuffeddog.com&#47;speller&#47;index.htm" target="_blank">this<&#47;a> XML-RPC accessible spell checker. This might make<br />
					it simple to provide spell checking on a website or with other tools.<br />
				<&#47;p></p>
<p>
					The reason I found these interesting is that the main reason I don't update<br />
					my page more is that it takes time to modify the source and publish it.<br />
					I would prefer an easier method of "posting" entries. John is tackling this<br />
					with a tools that he is specing out now, but it will be a while before<br />
					something big comes out of it.<br />
