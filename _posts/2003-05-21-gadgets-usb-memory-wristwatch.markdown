They don't provide measurements that I can find, but the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.laks.com" target="_blank">LAKS USB Memory<&#47;a> wristwatch looks pretty cool.<br />

It works on Windows, Linux, and Mac. That implies that it's driverless. If you are really adventurous, you can order them customized (minimum order 100). The 128MB version is 93 USD.<br />
