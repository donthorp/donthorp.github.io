					Well, not a lot has happened to write about, but John found a that<br />
					Adobe is finally taking the Palm seriously and has released a<br />
					beta of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.adobe.com&#47;products&#47;acrobat&#47;readerforpalm.html" target="_blank"><br />
					Acrobat Reader for the PalmOS<&#47;a>. I was really pumped up to see<br />
					it. I took a couple of seconds to download and install it and it really<br />
					does seem to work. Although, they recommend using Acrobat 5.0 to prepare the PDF<br />
					documents, the converter does work for some older documents.<br />
				<&#47;p></p>
<p>
					I did find out that a new book has been published by<br />
					<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.newriders.com" target="_blank">New Riders<&#47;a> covering VIM. It was<br />
					written by Steve Oualline, the title is "<br />
					<a href="http:&#47;&#47;http:&#47;&#47;www.newriders.com&#47;books&#47;title.cfm?isbn=0735710015" target="_blank"><br />
					Vi IMproved - Vim<&#47;a>". I'm finding that I'm needing to learn VIM the<br />
					more I work on *nix boxes. Since New Riders<br />
					is good about releasing quality books and it is pulling high marks on<br />
					<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;exec&#47;obidos&#47;ASIN&#47;0735710015&#47;o&#47;qid=990152393&#47;sr=8-1&#47;ref=aps_sr_b_1_1&#47;107-9207198-1168520" target="_blank">Amazon<&#47;a>,<br />
					I'm probably going to order it soon.<br />
