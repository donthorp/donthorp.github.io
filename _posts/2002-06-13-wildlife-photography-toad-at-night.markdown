Last night we were working late in the yard when this toad appears. Apparently he<br />
wanted some affection, because he kept trying to climb up into Laura's lap while<br />
she was pruning plants. Since she was in a working mood, she wasn't thrilled about<br />
having him interfere.<br />

The image was taken (2272x1704 with super fine compression, ISO 50, f 2.5) using my Canon G2.<br />
