  content: "Pretty room!!!  If you ever need help or suggestions I found this place
    pretty helpful - http:&#47;&#47;thatpainterlady.com&#47;forum&#47;  It's pretty
    neat!  \r\n\r\nI love the idea that you painted BROWN first before the red to
    give it depth!  That's a real saver so you don't have to paint the red 3 or 4
    times to cover the white underneath!  My daughter and her roommate&#47;landlord
    started to paint the dining room a deep red, but started on a bright white base.
    \ They got one coat on and haven't gone back to it.  Not very pretty at this point...but
    it'll get there.  Wish I'd thought of the brown coat first like you did and told
    them!"

  content: My Sister-in-law is an interior designer and she told me that her guys
    often use a brown coat under the red. We probably used a brown that was a little
    dark as a base, but we're really happy with the look we got.

She wanted her walls red with a dark wood floor. Given the experience we had with renovating my office in 2008, we were confident we could crank out most of the work over the MLK holiday weekend. As of this post we've completed everything except the baseboard and moving her in.</p>
<p>We ripped out the 13+ year old carpet and replaced it with a floating bamboo floor. The walls were painted with a dark brown (Behr Bison Brown) and then covered the brown with red (Behr Daredevil). The eggshell finish for the red gives it a glazed look and provides for an interesting finish over the brown. The original baseboard was repainted and replaced and shoe molding will be added to cover any gaps from contraction.</p>
<p>I hope to post a howto in the future, now that we've installed two floating floors using this bamboo flooring, </p>
