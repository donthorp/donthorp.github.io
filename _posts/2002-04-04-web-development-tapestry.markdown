<p>
I discovered a good <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.theserverside.com&#47;home&#47;thread.jsp?thread_id=12750" target="_blank">discussion<&#47;a> on Tapestry vs Struts at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.theserverside.com" target="_blank">The Server Side<&#47;a>. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;tapestry.sourceforge.net&#47;" target="_blank">Tapestry 2.0<&#47;a> has just been released and is now available. I haven't had time to do a review, but it does look like the component approach of Tapestry has some real benefits.<br />
