<p>
Today was the official launch of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.credant.com" target="_blank">Credant Technologies<&#47;a>.<br />
For those of you who don't know, this is the company I went to work for after leaving the last one.<br />
The "coming out" press release is entitled <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.credant.com&#47;newsMobileEnterprises.html" target="_blank">CREDANT TECHNOLOGIES (tm) First to Deliver Trusted Computing for Mobile Enterprises<&#47;a>.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
So for those of you have been wondering what the heck I'm working on, <strong>some<&#47;strong> information is now available.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
