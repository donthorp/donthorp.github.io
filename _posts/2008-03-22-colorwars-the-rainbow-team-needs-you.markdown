  content: I know I am the only one on Earth to admit this, but I don't get Twitter.  It
    seems like an amazing waste of time.  Am I missing something?

  content: It's one of those things that you may not get until you join. It covers
    the micro-blog space and allows you to post small thoughts and ideas. It also
    gets used like a more persistent instant messaging client for quick repartee.
    I've also met people I wouldn't have otherwise, because it allows you to follow
    their public thoughts.

<p>Ok, if you're on twitter, you need to jump over to the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;rainbowteam" target="_blank">@rainbowteam<&#47;a> and join by clicking follow. If you need to colorize your avatar <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Cali_Lewis" target="_blank">Cali Lewis<&#47;a> posted a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.bigtrip.tv&#47;rainbowteam.png">rainbowteam.png<&#47;a> to help you modify your avatar.</p>
<p>For the rest of you, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.zefrank.com" target="_blank">zefrank<&#47;a> wrote a post entitled  <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.zefrank.com&#47;zesblog&#47;archives&#47;2008&#47;03&#47;colorwar_2008.html" target="_blank">"colorwar 2008"<&#47;a> where he mused.</p>
<blockquote><p>
We used to play color wars at summer camp. Near the end of the year the entire camp would split up into colors, red, green, black, blue, etc... and compete in a series of events: tug of war, egg toss, basketball - sort of like the movie Meatballs, except all within the same camp.</p>
<p>During the summer we were divided into discreet units, older kids here, younger kids there, Hiawathans by the lake Tawasenthans by the ropes course, etc... But when it came time for color wars you had no idea who would be on your team. It was a release, and it was viciously fun.</p>
<p>So, for a while I've been thinking about how a color war might look online.<br />

<blockquote><p>If this isn&rsquo;t boredom, I don&rsquo;t know what is, but at least it gives us something to do.<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>While I'm not sure how this is going to play out, and I'm probably too busy anyway, I decided to join and and see what the fun might be. </p>
<p>Twitter is a very interesting place.</p>
