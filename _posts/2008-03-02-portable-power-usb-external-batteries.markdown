I originally thought he was worried about the end of life issue. The real issue is what do you do with a small child when the video device runs out of power at 30,000 feet. Enter the external USB battery pack.</p>
<p>My current "go to solution" is the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.apc.com&#47;resource&#47;include&#47;techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=UPB10" target="_blank">APC Mobile Power Pack, 10 Wh (UPB10) unit<&#47;a> from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.apc.com" target="_blank">APC<&#47;a>. Surprisingly, it gets used for my phone much more than for my iPods.</p>
<p>Looking through APC's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.apc.com&#47;products&#47;family&#47;index.cfm?id=314" target="_blank">Universal Mobile Device Batteries<&#47;a> product list, I saw a AAA battery powered unit the <a href="" _target="_blank"> APC USB Battery Extender (UPBX)<&#47;a>. This might be a good device to have around when you won't have power for charging the UPB10.</p>
