<p>
I have several new critters added to the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.donthorp.net&#47;gallery&#47;outdoors">Animals<&#47;a> album.<br />
There are a few pictures of a very small anole, several pictures of a mole that we found<br />
swimming in our pool, and one of a snake that I saw in the bushes at my mother's house.<br />
