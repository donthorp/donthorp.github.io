<p>I have to admit, I was part of the problem, but it is very hard to resist coming to the aid of another parent when challenged by a teenager. I woke up this morning and saw this tweet which I've edited to remove the actual phone number.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span style="color:blue">T+0h<&#47;span> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;leolaporte" target="_blank">leolaporte<&#47;a> My son Hank doesn't believe I have so many followers. He says text him if you follow me here. 707 XXX-YYYY. Let's see how many msgs he gets.<br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>Not long after, this tweet appeared.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span style="color:blue">T+0h<&#47;span> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;leolaporte" target="_blank">leolaporte<&#47;a>  OK that was a really bad idea. ;-)<br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>I woke up in this period and couldn't help but send my own text message to poor Hank. Telling him in fact that I did follow his dad on twitter. </p>
<p>Several hours later.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span style="color:blue">T+10h<&#47;span> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;leolaporte" target="_blank">leolaporte<&#47;a> Boy it sure is hard deleting old tweets. Pownce and Jaiku delete them right away. Guess Hank's phone will be unusable today.<br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>The damage assessment will come.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span style="color:blue">T+11h<&#47;span> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;leolaporte" target="_blank">leolaporte<&#47;a> I won't know the total number of text messages Hank received until I get the bill, but it was in the thousands. He had to turn off the phone<br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>And finally,</p>
<blockquote><p>
<span style="color:blue">T+11h<&#47;span> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;leolaporte" target="_blank">leolaporte<&#47;a> I DDoSed my own son.<br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>While it may be a little extreme you can't help but cheer just a little. How many times are parents challenged with no real way to prove a child wrong. Will it prevent Hank from challenging Dad in the future, probably not, he is a teenager after all. Will it make him think twice, just maybe.</p>
<p>Oh and the score in the title, the number of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com">Twitter<&#47;a> users following Leo that had the opportunity to send a nice encouraging text to Hank.</p>
