<p>As part of my site re-organization and update, I discovered a new plugin, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.tow.com&#47;projects&#47;wordpress&#47;wp-smugmug&#47;" target="_blank">WP-SmugMug<&#47;a> written by <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.tow.com&#47;about&#47;" target="_blank">Adam Tow<&#47;a>, that allows me to show recent photos from my SmugMug account on the site. Previously, the <b>Photos<&#47;b> menu item just took you directly to my photos, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;photos.donthorp.net" target="_blank">http:&#47;&#47;photos.donthorp.net<&#47;a>, on SmugMug. Now the link takes you to a local page that displays some recent photos and provides a link to all photos.</p>
<p>I had a couple of small issues with the plugin, version 2.0.3 and WordPress 2.7, but that didn't stop me from working around it for photos.</p>
<ol>
<li>The "Send to Editor" button didn't work for me so I had to enter the short code by hand (FireFox 3.0 and Safari on OS X Leopard)<&#47;li>
<li>When using the RSS feed for recently updated galleries, it didn't find the gallery images to display so I took that feature out.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol></p>
