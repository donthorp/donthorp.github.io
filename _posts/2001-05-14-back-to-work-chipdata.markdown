<h3>First Day Back To Work<&#47;h3></p>
<p>
					Today was my first day at ChipData. Everything went well. They had an office,<br />
					computer, phone, and projects all ready for me. This has to be the most organized first<br />
					day at a new company I've ever been through.<br />
				<&#47;p></p>
<h3>Quicky<&#47;h3></p>
<p>
					I spent last week working non-stop on projects around the house.<br />
					Hopefully some time this week, I'm going to post an article or two about the<br />
					projects. There were basically two big projects that I tackled: building<br />
					a bed next to the driveway so that I can relocate some shrubs and building<br />
					a replacement double gate in the fence to the backyard.<br />
