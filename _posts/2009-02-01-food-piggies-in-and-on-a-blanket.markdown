  content: We don't like a lot of breading on the lil smokies, so I usually cut the
    biscuits in half and stretch them out and wrap them in a spiral around the piggie.  Those
    look yummy though, no matter if they're wrapped up tight or not!

<p><img src="&#47;content&#47;uploads&#47;2009&#47;02&#47;img_1979-version-2-200x150.jpg" alt="Piggie in a Blanket" title="img_1979-version-2-200x150" width="200" height="150" class="size-full wp-image-301" style="float:left; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px"&#47;> Today I attempted to make piggies in a blanket. The recipe is simple.</p>
<blockquote><p>
1 or more tubes of biscuits<br />
1 little smokie per biscuit<br />
Use cooking times and temperature from biscuit packaging.</p>
<p>Lightly grease a cookie sheet. Using one sausage per biscuit, wrap the smokie snuggly with a biscuit and place on the cookie sheet.<br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>Apparently, I failed the "wrap smokie snuggly" part on some of the "Piggies in a Blanket" and ended up with new recipe which I've called "Piggies In and On a Blanket". Next time I will try wetting the edge of the biscuit so that it stays together, or roll the biscuit until it appears seamless.</p>
