Ok, normally, I never use the work "Rocks" in a sentence unless I'm telling a bunch of kids to stop throwing them, but it this case I made an exception. In general, cygwin (you can find it at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sources.redhat.com&#47;cygwin" target="_blank">http:&#47;&#47;sources.redhat.com&#47;cygwin<&#47;a>) provides a unix type environment under windows. Which by itself, is a major plus.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
What prompted today's outburst was a simple question I asked..."I wonder if it is possible to run sshd under Win2K&#47;XP"? The simple answer is <b>YES<&#47;b>. Using google, I found this link <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www-co.ch.cam.ac.uk&#47;facilities&#47;misc&#47;cygwin.html" target="_blank">http:&#47;&#47;www-co.ch.cam.ac.uk&#47;facilities&#47;misc&#47;cygwin.html<&#47;a> which gives a quick walk through of how to do it. Now I can access my box from the network using command line tools over a secure channel instead of relying on GUI tools. Once again, the open source movement comes through.<br />
