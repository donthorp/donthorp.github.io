<p><img src="&#47;content&#47;uploads&#47;2009&#47;01&#47;banking.gif" alt="banking" title="banking" width="79" height="49" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-228" &#47;>I learned something new today about a system called "Positive Pay" that's used in the banking system. It's one of those systems that you just wouldn't notice until something went wrong. </p>
<p>Earlier today, I tried depositing a check from a company only to have the the teller inform me that it couldn't be deposited today. When I asked why, she told me it was due to the fact that it wasn't in the system. Once I got home and looked up the number for the company, I called them, explained the situation, and they simply retransmitted the check details. </p>
<p>Since I helped build an ACH processing solution, I was curious about what this system entailed. Descriptions from several locations appeared using this <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;search?q=positive+pay" target="_blank">Google search<&#47;a>. One of the better descriptions was from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.positivepay.net&#47;index.htm" target="_blank">SafeChecks<&#47;a>. Here is an excerpt.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Positive Pay is an automated fraud detection tool offered by the Cash Management Department of most banks. In its simplest form, it is a service that matches the <b>account number<&#47;b>, <b>check number<&#47;b> and <b>dollar<&#47;b> amount of each check presented for payment against a list of checks previously authorized and issued by the company. All three components of the check must match exactly or it will not pay.<br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>The purpose of this system is to help prevent check fraud and the simplicity of it is encouraging. I can only hope that during transmittal they take the time to digitally sign the transactions.</p>
