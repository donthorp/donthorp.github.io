    Princess\" reminds me somewhat of my own Darling Princess Diva. \r\n\r\nTo cute!"

<p>I woke up at 4am, no idea why, if anyone does know, please fill me in. Anyway, I decided to catch up on the world around me so I fired up <a href="http:&#47;&#47;friendfeed.com&#47;donthorp" target="_blank">my FriendFeed<&#47;a> and started browsing. </p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;friendfeed.com&#47;" target="_blank">FriendFeed<&#47;a> is a wonderful aggregation service that simplifies keeping in touch with friends and family. FriendFeed lets you publish the data from your blog, social network sites, photos, and other places for others to see without them having to visit each site individually. It also has an interesting twist in that you can create <b>Imaginary Friends<&#47;b> where you put in the services you want to watch even if the person doesn't have a FriendFeed account.</p>
<p>While catching up on my brother <a href="http:&#47;&#47;friendfeed.com&#47;jmthorp" target="_blank">Michael's<&#47;a> feed I stumbled upon two separate pictures of my niece and nephew that had to be mashed. Enjoy.</p>
