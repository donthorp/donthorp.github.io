					I was searching around on Microsoft's website looking for security patches<br />
					when I happened across this handy article "<br />
					<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.microsoft.com&#47;TechNet&#47;security&#47;secpatch.asp" target="_blank"><br />
					Where to Find Microsoft Security Patches<&#47;a>". The most interesting part<br />
					was learning about the existence of the<br />
					<a href="http:&#47;&#47;corporate.windowsupdate.com&#47;en&#47;default.asp" target="_blank"><br />
					Windows Update Corporate Site<&#47;a>. It allows you to download the patches for<br />
					installation on multiple machines. This could be a <strong>huge<&#47;strong><br />
					time saver.<br />
				<&#47;p></p>
<h3>Father's Day Goodies<&#47;h3></p>
<h4>USB Radio<&#47;h4></p>
<p>
					Well I was surprised on Father's day on a couple of fronts. The USB Radio<br />
					that I mentioned earlier was wrapped and presented as one of my gifts. I<br />
					brought it to the office on Monday to give it a whirl. Believe it or not,<br />
					it actually works well. The building I'm in is not really conducive to<br />
					good radio reception, but I do get several stations. There is a little bit<br />
					of background hiss, but I'm hoping to get better reception when we move to a<br />
					new location. I may take it home over the weekend and try it there.<br />
				<&#47;p></p>
<p>
					The only real gripe I have is with the software. It is your typical GUI<br />
					utility from a hardware company. Some cool features are there, it has<br />
					terrible art, but the really useful stuff is several revisions away.<br />
				<&#47;p></p>
<p>
					I did notice in their README, that they do have an SDK. I'm going to try and<br />
					find it and see if I can generate those additional features I want.<br />
				<&#47;p></p>
<h4>Harry Potter<&#47;h4></p>
<p>
					It started innocently enough -- I wanted a fun book to read during a<br />
					soccer tournament in Austin. Not wanting to purchase a new book, I thought<br />
					I'd just dip into my son's Harry Potter collection and see what it was all<br />
					about. Not expecting much from the book or that I would have much reading<br />
					time, I only took book one.<br />
				<&#47;p></p>
<p>
					Book one lasted less than a day. Desperate for more, I took a late night<br />
					trip to Target and found the one remaining paperback copy of book two. It was<br />
					finished before we got home.<br />
				<&#47;p></p>
<p>
					For those of you who don't know, I get up early,<br />
					5:30 am, to get to work. I have about a 30 mile commute each way and the only<br />
					way to not spend my entire life on the road is to leave the house by 6:00 am<br />
					and leave the office between 3:00 pm - 4:00 pm.<br />
				<&#47;p></p>
<p>
					If you haven't guessed already, following Mr. Potter on his adventures and<br />
					going to work early, really don't mix very well. I didn't sleep much the<br />
					next week having been compelled to finish books three and four. It really<br />
					was much more important than sleep.<br />
				<&#47;p></p>
<p>
					This long winded explanation, brings me to the gifts. My son presented me<br />
					with several of the collectible trinkets (they look like hard gummies) and<br />
					a wand that he carved himself. I think he really enjoyed making it and I<br />
					know I enjoyed receiving it.<br />
