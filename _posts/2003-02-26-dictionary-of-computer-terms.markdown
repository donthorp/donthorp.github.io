<h3>Dictionary of Computer Terms<&#47;h3></p>
<p>While researching a project for work, I needed to get definitions of some computer terms. Not being comfortable with my connotation of the terms, I used <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.google.com" target="_blank">Google<&#47;a> to search for other definitions.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>After spending a fair amount of time googling, I ran across this gem: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;whatis.techtarget.com&#47;" target="_blank">whatis?com<&#47;a>.<br />
According to whatis, it contains "Definitions for thousands of the most current IT-related words". Most importantly, it provided the definitions of the terms I was trying to clarify.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
