Believe it or not, I've finally converted to Moveable Type. It only to a couple of hours and now I have it spitting out the xml format I was using before. It is impressive how easy it was to convert. I still have a lot more work todo to incorporate archives and categories, but it will be much easier to add entries than it was before.<br />
