<p>Every once in a while, you have one of &ldquo;those days&rdquo;. April 10, 2008 was one of those days.  </p>
<p>The day started around 3:40am when a wall of wind and water hit the house. Tornados are not uncommon so I do feel an obligation to check for them which weather like this happens. Confident that we weren&rsquo;t about to land in the Oz, I crawled back in bed to enjoy the storm. I really do like sleeping when it&rsquo;s raining.</p>
<p> Five minutes later, I&rsquo;m awakened by the crickets of the computer age, the UPS on battery. Some demented person must have wasted a good part of their life to come up with that sound. Although, it&rsquo;s not quite as bad as the chirp from a smoke alarm with a dying battery. After 15 minutes with no power, I crawl out of bed and successfully shut everything down. Afraid I might oversleep, I grab my mobile, set the alarm, and crawl back into bed. </p>
<p>Of course, I can&rsquo;t fall back asleep. After locating a flashlight I spent 10 minutes locating the number for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.txu.com" target="_blank">TXU<&#47;a>&rsquo;s power outage hotline. Keying it in my phone informs me that the number had been previously saved. I put it there to save myself some time after the last power outage. I call the hotline and report it, the automated attendant happily informs me that they have no idea when the power will be restored. I flop back in bed. </p>
<p>The mobile alarm functions as expected and I wake to the silence of the power impaired. At least there was hot water in the tank so we were able to clean up a bit. I had to figure out how to shave with limited lighting. I would say it was like camping, but honestly, who shaves on a camping trip. I would have blown it off, but I had to interview someone at the office today. On the positive side, the blood loss was kept to a minimum. Oh, and checking with TXU, still no word on when the power would be restored.</p>
<p><img src="&#47;content&#47;uploads&#47;2008&#47;05&#47;american.jpg" alt="Photo of american airlines airplane tails" title="american" width="175" height="175" class="size-medium wp-image-81" style="float:left" &#47;> You would think that would be enough for today, but no. I forgot to mention that Alex and I were headed to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.american.edu" target="_blank">American University<&#47;a> tonight. Given that we live in the Dallas area, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.aa.com" target="_blank">American Airlines<&#47;a> is the easiest carrier to use for most flights. Guess who <a href="http:&#47;&#47;tailrank.com&#47;5656923&#47;American-cancels-more-than-1-000-flights" target="_blank">"forgot" to inspect their planes<&#47;a>. Checking the website all morning the flight showed as on time. I went to lunch thinking we&rsquo;re still going, come back and right before I race home, find out it&rsquo;s been canceled.</p>
<p>To see if I can salvage the trip, I immediately try to get an agent. After sitting on hold for 15 minutes or so I actually get a live person, who then takes 20 minutes to tell me that there are not flights. I ask her to please schedule us for the same trip next week. Of course she says, let me put you on hold, where I sit for 15 minutes and then get disconnected. In the middle of this Alex gets to the house where he discovers that the garage door won&rsquo;t open and he doesn&rsquo;t have his house key. So I call American back, on my mobile this time and start driving home.</p>
<p>After 25 minutes I get another agent who is able to successfully reschedule us for the next week in only 20 minutes, with out loosing me when she had to put me on hold. A few minutes later I reach the house and let Alex in and then start trying to deal with the hotel and cars. Let me just say, dealing with the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.Expedia.com" target="_blank">Expedia<&#47;a> rep was fast, efficient, and painless. Oh, yes the power was on, It only took them 12 hours.</p>
<p>Relieved, I decided to check <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook<&#47;a> only to discover that a good friend was having a crisis, she couldn&rsquo;t decide what color to paint her toenails. Thinking I could help I suggested maroon and white, apparently <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ou.edu&#47;web&#47;home.html" target="_blank">OU<&#47;a>&rsquo;s colors are crimson and cream, I had to apologize profusely, and now I know there is a difference. Oh and she chose cotton candy to celebrate Spring.</p>
<p>Finally, I didn&rsquo;t forget to wish my mother a Happy Birthday. Given the rest of the day, I consider that a minor miracle.</p>
