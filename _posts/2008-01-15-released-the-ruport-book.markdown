<p>I just received a notification email that the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ruportbook.com&#47;" target="_blank">Ruport Book 1.0.0<&#47;a> has been released and is available on Lulu as <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.lulu.com&#47;content&#47;1700117">"The Ruport Book"<&#47;a>. </p>
<p>I'm working on a project that needs to process various items and present them in xml and html. I spent several hours with the beta version of the book this last weekend and found it to be very helpful in getting up and running. The book makes it easier to understand <a href="http:&#47;&#47;rubyreports.org&#47;" target="_blank">Ruport<&#47;a> and it's a worthy addition to your bookshelf.</p>
<p>At the time of release, the PDF version of the book is listed for $8.50 and the paperback book is listed for $30.00. I'm looking forward to my physical copy arriving in a week or so. I purchased a bundle in advance to receive both items.</p>
<p>If you do any reporting you should really consider purchasing this book and supporting the project. That being said, they do provide a free version of the text at the ruby reports website.</p>
