<p>Just a quick note to let you know that parts of the site will be missing, mostly pictures, as I upgrade to the latest WordPress. I seem to have gotten everything updated except for Gallery. I've always had a love hate relationship with it and I think the hate side has won. I'm going to be galleries up to smugmug, and probably putting post graphics locally. This is going to be a little painful, mostly for me.</p>
<p>Pardon the dust.</p>
