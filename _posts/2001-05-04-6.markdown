<p>
					I visited a new Qwest data center near my home with Jim Milo from wirecrossing.com.<br />
					This center opened 14 Feb 2001 and is only 10 minutes from my house. I can't<br />
					consider moving servers into it yet, but it would be much closer to my house<br />
					than driving 20+ miles to downtown Dallas. Everything is in a n+1 configuration<br />
					making it pretty reliable.<br />
