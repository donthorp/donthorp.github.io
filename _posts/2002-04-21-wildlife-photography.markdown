    It's sometimes hard to believe that we actually live in a suburban neighborhood.<br />
    In the <em>"I wish I had my camera"<&#47;em> department, I was greeted by the honking of two canadian geese as they flew by me about 15 feet off the ground. Today, I walked up to a tree in our back yard and found a nesting dove.<br />
<&#47;p></p>
<p>
    It took a while to get these pictures, but in the end, she cooperated and provided me with the opportunity to share them with you.<br />

    It was a cold winter night when an opossum decided to visit us. Laura saw him walking around on our porch. When I got outside, he moved up into the tree and posed for these pictures.<br />
