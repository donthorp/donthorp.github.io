<p>I use Gmail as a mail aggregator for many of my accounts. I honestly do strive for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.43folders.com&#47;izero" target="_blank">Inbox Zero<&#47;a> but I'm not very consistent. As part of the quest, I've become relatively proficient at typing in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;mail.google.com&#47;support&#47;bin&#47;answer.py?answer=7190&cbid=wz41m591lvqd&src=cb&lev=answer" target="_blank">advanced search<&#47;a> query strings, but it is a real time sink to hand enter those every day. Enter <a href="http:&#47;&#47;gmailblog.blogspot.com&#47;2008&#47;06&#47;introducing-gmail-labs.html" target="_blank">Gmail Labs<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>On June 5, 2008 Google announced Gmail Labs in the official <a href="http:&#47;&#47;gmailblog.blogspot.com&#47;" target="_blank">Gmail Blog<&#47;a>. Being an early adopter, I turned labs on in Gmail almost immediately after reading the post but didn't look at the features closely. This morning I woke up and realized I was failing miserably in maintaining my inbox and decided to make a dent. The frustration led me to search gmail help to see if there was any way to save&#47;bookmark advanced searches. That's when I stumbled on to Quick Links.</p>
<p><img src="&#47;content&#47;uploads&#47;2008&#47;07&#47;picture-2.png" alt="" title="Gmail Quick Links" width="649" height="94" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-91" &#47;></p>
<p>Gmail Labs, being experimental, are not enabled by default. You may have to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;lifehacker.com&#47;395285&#47;manually-enable-gmail-labs-in-your-account" target="_blank">Manually Enable Gmail Labs in Your Account<&#47;a>. Once labs are enabled, you are allowed to control the features on an individual basis. As you can see if the photo above, I have Quick Links enabled.</p>
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="&#47;content&#47;uploads&#47;2008&#47;07&#47;picture-3.png" alt="Example of my personal Quick Links" title="My Quick Links" width="147" height="79" class="" style="text-align: center" &#47;><&#47;div></p>
<p>For example, the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter<&#47;a> Quick Link shows all of the email from Twitter in my Inbox using the search below. One nice touch is that clicking on the Quick Link re-populates the search field allowing you to specify additional search criteria.</p>
<blockquote><p>
from:twitter in:inbox<br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>I know this feature won't solve all of my Inbox Zero issues, but I'm hoping it will help me quickly wade through items that I don't want processed by a rule and want to look at before archiving or deleting. Happy Cleaning!</p>
