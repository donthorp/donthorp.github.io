  content: You would think that might at least merit a mention at work so you didn't

<p>I've worked at my "day job", <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.credant.com" target"_blank">CREDANT Technologies, Inc<&#47;a>, for almost six years now. I happened to run across an article in the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.bizjournals.com&#47;dallas&#47;" target="_blank">Dallas Business Journal<&#47;a> and found out that <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.bizjournals.com&#47;dallas&#47;stories&#47;2008&#47;01&#47;28&#47;newscolumn4.html?b=1201496400^1581658" target="_blank">Credant investors ante up $5M in 'top-off' funding round<&#47;a>. Not completely surprised, but I definitely wasn't expecting it.</p>
