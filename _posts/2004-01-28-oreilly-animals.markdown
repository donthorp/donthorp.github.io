<p><img hspace="5" src="http:&#47;&#47;www.oreilly.com&#47;catalog&#47;covers&#47;jenut3.s.gif" align="left"> A co-worker dropped in and picked up one of my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.oreilly.com" target="_blank">O'Reilly<&#47;a> books and mused outloud about a cover with an alligator on it. It took a little bit of digging, but I finally found <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.oreilly.com&#47;animals.html" target="_blank">The Animal Menagerie<&#47;a>, a listing of all the books and their animals. <&#47;p>
<p>In case you're wondering, the book with an alligator is <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.oreilly.com&#47;catalog&#47;jenut3&#47;index.html" target="_blank">Java Examples in a Nutshell<&#47;a>. It's not one that I have in my personal library. I'm at the point where adding many more books would require an addition on the house. <&#47;p></p>
