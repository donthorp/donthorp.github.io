<p>During the middle of last week, a person I follow on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;jackstevison" target="_blank">Jack Stevison<&#47;a>, published his recipe for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jackstevison.com&#47;weblog&#47;?p=190" target="_blank">Ten-Hour Beef<&#47;a>. I'm not much of a beef person anymore, so I decided to see if I could adapt it to pork.<br />
<img src="&#47;content&#47;uploads&#47;2008&#47;05&#47;bbq_tenn.jpg" alt="Bottle of sauce" title="Barbecue Sauce Photo" width="185" height="183" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-88" style="float:right" &#47;></p>
<h2>The Recipe<&#47;h2></p>
<p>1 Pork roast (5 lbs)<br />
2 Purple onions<br />
4 <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Serrano_pepper" target="_blank">Serrano peppers<&#47;a><br />
1 Bottle <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.guinness.com&#47;templates&#47;GenericTemplate.aspx?NRMODE=Published&NRNODEGUID=%7bF4BC94ED-2A9B-405A-810C-18E445BFA13F%7d&NRORIGINALURL=%2fus_en%2fbeer%2fextraStout%2f&NRCACHEHINT=Guest&allowAccess=4r7a6h&refUrl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.guinness.com%2ftemplates%2fGenericTemplate.aspx%3fNRMODE%3dPublished%26NRNODEGUID%3d%257bF4BC94ED-2A9B-405A-810C-18E445BFA13F%257d%26NRORIGINALURL%3d%252fus_en%252fbeer%252fextraStout%252f%26NRCACHEHINT%3dGuest&RhLanguage=en-us&RhFlashEnabled=0&RhCountry=US&RhYear=1963&RhRemDetails=True&RhReferer=landingpage.guinness.com&gatewayStatusCode=10&me=hwq2oq55yijh3b3hzmdxrz45" target="_blank">Guinness Extra Stout<&#47;a><br />
2 Bottles <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.jackdanielssauces.com&#47;bbq&#47;bbq_products.aspx" target="_blank">Jack Daniel's&reg; Hickory Brown Sugar Barbecue Sauce<&#47;a></p>
<p>Also needed: Salt, Pepper, Garlic,  and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Worcestershire_sauce" target="_blank">Worcestershire Sauce<&#47;a></p>
<p>Trim excess fat off of the roast and slice into 3&#47;8 strips. De-seed and slice the peppers into thin strips. Slice the onions and place half of them and half of the peppers on the bottom of the crock pot. Layer the pork slices on top of the onions and then cover with the remaining onions and peppers. Pour the Guinness and one bottle of the Jack Daniel's sauce over the top. Cover and cook on high (6 hour setting on my crock pot) for 1.5 to 2 hours. </p>
<p>After the first two hours, stir gently to move things around and reduce the heat to low (8 hour setting). I stirred every hour for the next 7 hours. At this point pork should be tender and can be pulled apart with a fork, but does not disintegrate on touch. </p>
<p>This part came as a tip from my brother <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;jmthorp" target="_blank">Michael<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>Pre-heat the oven to 375. While it's heating, lightly oil a cookie sheet, then transfer the solid materials with a slotted spoon from the crock pot to the cookie sheet. Using about half of the other bottle of barbecue sauce, cover the meat with a light (~1&#47;16 inch to 1&#47;8 inch) layer of sauce. I used a brush to make sure things were covered evenly. Once the oven is heated, place the cookie sheet in the oven and cook uncovered for an additional 15-25 minutes. </p>
<p>Take the sheet out of the oven and gently pull the pork apart with two forks. Mix lightly to spread the sauce and serve. </p>
<p>You may want to save some of the liquid from the crock pot to store with leftovers to keep it moist when re-heated.</p>
