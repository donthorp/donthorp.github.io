Animals are posing all over the place. This crane was fishing in a ditch after a thunderstorm. It has been in the area for quite some time, but I never seemed to have my camera ready.</p>


<p>I had to make a quick trip up to the school, saw it, came home to get the camera and found him still there. Made for a fun day.</p>

<p>I went to clean out the pool skimmer today and found this little guy. He was about 36 inches long and very docile. When I was carrying him around in the bucket, Home Depot issue if you couldn't tell, he became a little agitated and started rattling his tail and opening his mouth very wide.  Although he has no rattles on his tail, he is able to vibrate it quickly enough to make the sound.</p>


<p>After photographing him and showing him to family and neighbors, my daughter and I dropped him off at a local pond. The University of Texas has information in their <a href="http://www.lifesci.utexas.edu/research/txherps/snakes/elaphe.emoryi.html" target="_blank">Herps of Texas - Snakes</a> area.</p>

I have added a new <a href="http://www.donthorp.net/gallery/outdoors">Insects</a> album.<br />
A photo with a katydid and grasshopper on the same stalk, a spider<br />
(my kids call it a banana spider), and a katydid at night.</p>

I had a big scare the other day. We went to my daughter's<br />
<a href="http://www.donthorp.net/gallery/allibridging">Brownie Bridging Ceremony</a><br />
where I took several once in a lifetime photos. While we were at the ceremony, we reviewed<br />
the photos many times and everything look great.</p>


<p>
When I got home, I started to pull the images from the CF card and noticed that<br />
there were no photos! The card showed that it had almost 57MB used, but the<br />
directory must have been corrupted.  So that I wouldn't mess things up, I left<br />
the card alone.</p>


<p>
After a few hours, I did a google search and found this gem:<br />
<a href="http://home.arcor.de/christian_grau/dir/index.html" target="blank">Digital Image Recovery</a>.<br />
Not only is this tool free, it was able to pull the images off the CF card.  If you<br />
run into a similar problem, try this tool. It doesn't do any writes to the card so<br />
it is pretty safe. I keep saying card, but the software works with any device<br />
that can be mounted as a drive.</p>

I have several new critters added to the <a href="http://www.donthorp.net/gallery/outdoors">Animals</a> album.<br />
There are a few pictures of a very small anole, several pictures of a mole that we found<br />
swimming in our pool, and one of a snake that I saw in the bushes at my mother's house.</p>
