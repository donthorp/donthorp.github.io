    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We've decided to sell the boat. There are several reason for the decision</p>


<ol>
<li>The closest lake has been too low, ramps closed</li>
<li>The closest lake has been too high, ramps closed</li>
<li>The slip fees at the closest marina are outrageous ~ $4000 per year which means I wouldn't have to worry about the ramps.</li>
<li>Alex is headed off to school and we're trying to get rid of all payments</li>
</ol>


<p>We've had a lot of good times on the boat both at home and away. My favorite trip was a week in Branson, MO. I was able to go out on a whim because it was in a slip a short walk from the condo.</p>
