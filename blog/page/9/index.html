Ok, normally, I never use the work &#8220;Rocks&#8221; in a sentence unless I&#8217;m telling a bunch of kids to stop throwing them, but it this case I made an exception. In general, cygwin (you can find it at <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin" target="_blank">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin</a>) provides a unix type environment under windows. Which by itself, is a major plus.</p>


<p>
What prompted today&#8217;s outburst was a simple question I asked&#8230;&#8221;I wonder if it is possible to run sshd under Win2K/XP&#8221;? The simple answer is <b>YES</b>. Using google, I found this link <a href="http://www-co.ch.cam.ac.uk/facilities/misc/cygwin.html" target="_blank">http://www-co.ch.cam.ac.uk/facilities/misc/cygwin.html</a> which gives a quick walk through of how to do it. Now I can access my box from the network using command line tools over a secure channel instead of relying on GUI tools. Once again, the open source movement comes through.</p>

Every once in a while, you find an article on Microsoft&#8217;s knowledge base that actually helps answer questions you&#8217;ve had for a long time. While researching why a process was eating up so much of my CPU I found the following article - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/search/preview.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;Q314056" target="_blank">A Description of Svchost.exe in Windows XP (Q314056)</a>.</p>


<p>
For years I&#8217;ve wondered how to find out what tasks were behind <code>svchost.exe</code>; this article shows you how.  At a command prompt simply type <code>tasklist /svc</code>.</p>

I haven&#8217;t had time to do a review, but it does look like the component approach of Tapestry has some real benefits.</p>

Believe it or not, I&#8217;ve finally converted to Moveable Type. It only to a couple of hours and now I have it spitting out the xml format I was using before. It is impressive how easy it was to convert. I still have a lot more work todo to incorporate archives and categories, but it will be much easier to add entries than it was before.</p>

                    As you can tell from the time difference between now and the last<br />
                    entry, I&#8217;ve been busy.
                </p>


<p>
                    The other problem is the effort it takes to update the site. I&#8217;m<br />
                    considering using <a href="http://www.moveabletype.org" target="_blank"><br />
                    Moveable Type</a> for web log entries. John has been using it for a while,<br />
                    and it seemed to make it easier for him to add updates. If I can wade<br />
                    through the documentation and figure out how to convert my information<br />
                    easily, I&#8217;ll probably do it to.

                    Most of my time is being spent right now at work. We are trying to get<br />
                    a product out the door on a really tight schedule. That is preventing<br />
                    me from doing much of anything on the site right now, but I have finally<br />
                    captured the last image from the flower bed project and will work to<br />
                    get them online as soon as I can.

<h3>Frosted Hair Is In</h3>


<p>
                    My son has been begging to get his hair frosted so we finally gave in,<br />
                    and Laura frosted it tonight. I snapped some photos for posterity. It<br />
                    also really highlight the limits of the little Intel ProShare camera<br />
                    that I snapped the pics with.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
                    Believe it or not, the lack of updates does not signal my demise. Life has<br />
                    been really hectic lately and getting updates to the website has just been<br />
                    close to impossible.
                </p>


<p>
                    I have ton of resource links that I need to get added, but I&#8217;m going to<br />
                    hold off for a little while, until John finished is experiment with OPML.<br />
                    I already keep my resource list in xml form, but I&#8217;m open to using a standard<br />
                    that has tools available.
                </p>


<h3>XML-RPC</h3>


<p>
                    Today I was reading on Meerkat and found an interesting topic on using<br />
                    XML-RPC to manage your weblog on Blogger and another product called<br />
                    <a href="http://www.free-conversant.com/" target="_blank">Free Conversant</a>.<br />
                    I haven&#8217;t read through it, but first glance seems to indicate that it comes<br />
                    in a open form that we could run on our own servers.
                </p>


<p>
                    I also happened upon <a href="http://www.stuffeddog.com/speller/index.htm" target="_blank">this</a> XML-RPC accessible spell checker. This might make<br />
                    it simple to provide spell checking on a website or with other tools.
                </p>


<p>
                    The reason I found these interesting is that the main reason I don&#8217;t update<br />
                    my page more is that it takes time to modify the source and publish it.<br />
                    I would prefer an easier method of &#8220;posting&#8221; entries. John is tackling this<br />
                    with a tools that he is specing out now, but it will be a while before<br />
                    something big comes out of it.
                </p>

                    I was searching around on Microsoft&#8217;s website looking for security patches<br />
                    when I happened across this handy article &quot;<br />
                    <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/security/secpatch.asp" target="_blank"><br />
                    Where to Find Microsoft Security Patches</a>&quot;. The most interesting part<br />
                    was learning about the existence of the<br />
                    <a href="http://corporate.windowsupdate.com/en/default.asp" target="_blank"><br />
                    Windows Update Corporate Site</a>. It allows you to download the patches for<br />
                    installation on multiple machines. This could be a <strong>huge</strong><br />
                    time saver.

<h3>Father&#8217;s Day Goodies</h3>


<h4>USB Radio</h4>


<p>
                    Well I was surprised on Father&#8217;s day on a couple of fronts. The USB Radio<br />
                    that I mentioned earlier was wrapped and presented as one of my gifts. I<br />
                    brought it to the office on Monday to give it a whirl. Believe it or not,<br />
                    it actually works well. The building I&#8217;m in is not really conducive to<br />
                    good radio reception, but I do get several stations. There is a little bit<br />
                    of background hiss, but I&#8217;m hoping to get better reception when we move to a<br />
                    new location. I may take it home over the weekend and try it there.
                </p>


<p>
                    The only real gripe I have is with the software. It is your typical GUI<br />
                    utility from a hardware company. Some cool features are there, it has<br />
                    terrible art, but the really useful stuff is several revisions away.
                </p>


<p>
                    I did notice in their README, that they do have an SDK. I&#8217;m going to try and<br />
                    find it and see if I can generate those additional features I want.
                </p>


<h4>Harry Potter</h4>


<p>
                    It started innocently enough &#8211; I wanted a fun book to read during a<br />
                    soccer tournament in Austin. Not wanting to purchase a new book, I thought<br />
                    I&#8217;d just dip into my son&#8217;s Harry Potter collection and see what it was all<br />
                    about. Not expecting much from the book or that I would have much reading<br />
                    time, I only took book one.
                </p>


<p>
                    Book one lasted less than a day. Desperate for more, I took a late night<br />
                    trip to Target and found the one remaining paperback copy of book two. It was<br />
                    finished before we got home.
                </p>


<p>
                    For those of you who don&#8217;t know, I get up early,<br />
                    5:30 am, to get to work. I have about a 30 mile commute each way and the only<br />
                    way to not spend my entire life on the road is to leave the house by 6:00 am<br />
                    and leave the office between 3:00 pm - 4:00 pm.
                </p>


<p>
                    If you haven&#8217;t guessed already, following Mr. Potter on his adventures and<br />
                    going to work early, really don&#8217;t mix very well. I didn&#8217;t sleep much the<br />
                    next week having been compelled to finish books three and four. It really<br />
                    was much more important than sleep.
                </p>


<p>
                    This long winded explanation, brings me to the gifts. My son presented me<br />
                    with several of the collectible trinkets (they look like hard gummies) and<br />
                    a wand that he carved himself. I think he really enjoyed making it and I<br />
                    know I enjoyed receiving it.
