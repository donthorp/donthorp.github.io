  <div class="entry-content"><p>
I had a big scare the other day. We went to my daughter&#8217;s<br />
<a href="http://www.donthorp.net/gallery/allibridging">Brownie Bridging Ceremony</a><br />
where I took several once in a lifetime photos. While we were at the ceremony, we reviewed<br />
the photos many times and everything look great.</p>


<p>
When I got home, I started to pull the images from the CF card and noticed that<br />
there were no photos! The card showed that it had almost 57MB used, but the<br />
directory must have been corrupted.  So that I wouldn&#8217;t mess things up, I left<br />
the card alone.</p>


<p>
After a few hours, I did a google search and found this gem:<br />
<a href="http://home.arcor.de/christian_grau/dir/index.html" target="blank">Digital Image Recovery</a>.<br />
Not only is this tool free, it was able to pull the images off the CF card.  If you<br />
run into a similar problem, try this tool. It doesn&#8217;t do any writes to the card so<br />
it is pretty safe. I keep saying card, but the software works with any device<br />
that can be mounted as a drive.</p>

swimming in our pool, and one of a snake that I saw in the bushes at my mother&#8217;s house.</p>

I&#8217;ve been fairly motivated lately to start getting some of our pictures online. To<br />
that end, I installed <a href="http://gallery.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Photo Gallery</a><br />
an open source tool for managing and displaying collections of photos.</p>

Since that will take a while, I decided to post  some panorama&#8217;s of the ruins of Tulum.  Click on<br />

Last night we were working late in the yard when this toad appears. Apparently he<br />
wanted some affection, because he kept trying to climb up into Laura&#8217;s lap while<br />
she was pruning plants. Since she was in a working mood, she wasn&#8217;t thrilled about<br />
having him interfere.</p>


<p>
The image was taken (2272x1704 with super fine compression, ISO 50, f 2.5) using my Canon G2.</p>

    It&#8217;s sometimes hard to believe that we actually live in a suburban neighborhood.<br />
    In the <em>&quot;I wish I had my camera&quot;</em> department, I was greeted by the honking of two canadian geese as they flew by me about 15 feet off the ground. Today, I walked up to a tree in our back yard and found a nesting dove.</p>


<p>
    It took a while to get these pictures, but in the end, she cooperated and provided me with the opportunity to share them with you.</p>

    It was a cold winter night when an opossum decided to visit us. Laura saw him walking around on our porch. When I got outside, he moved up into the tree and posed for these pictures.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>
Before you say&#8230;&#8221;you really should pay more attention&#8221;, I just want you to know<br />
I&#8217;ve been <b>REALLY</b> swamped at work. We have a really important deadline<br />
 looming so I had to let some things slide. On to the mystery!</p>


<p>
For the last couple of weeks I&#8217;ve been wondering why this website has been<br />
taking 5 to 6 seconds to return a page. This website and<br />
<a href="http://www.johnmunsch.com" target="_blank">John&#8217;s</a> are<br />
webapps under Tomcat 3.2.2 and have been running that way for quite a while.<br />
When we first set up our sites, I remember being impressed with the<br />
responsiveness of Tomcat. But lately, it has been depressingly slow and I<br />
just couldn&#8217;t imagine why. The normal Apache sites were responding very<br />
nicely, but the JSP based sites were sluggish.</p>


<p>
Having a hard time waking up this morning, I decided to do a little<br />
sleuthing. I spent a good deal of time with<br />
my friends google and the Tomcat mailing list archives and found absolutely<br />
nothing that was related to my problem. Finally waking up at the office and<br />
getting busy, I forgot my search &#8230; for a while.</p>


<p>
Having a few extra minutes before bedtime, I decided to explore the server. Acting on a<br />
whim, I decided to check disk utilization. At this point in my story most of you<br />
probably just slapped you head and said &#8220;DUH! What do you expect!&#8221; and you&#8217;d<br />
be right <code>/var</code> was out of space.</p>


<p>
Knowing how expensive exceptions can be in general, and especially since<br />
Tomcat was logging to <code>/var</code> I decided to do some spring cleaning. After<br />
moving the logs to another filesystem for archiving, I<br />
restarted the server and then slapped my own head.</p>


<p> My website returned in &lt; 3 seconds on the first pull and &lt; 2 seconds on the second.<br />
John&#8217;s site being lighter weight than mine<br />
now has a sub-second response time! All this time I had been worrying about<br />
Tomcat as a deployment platform, and it was simple sloth (on my part) that<br />
caused the whole thing.</p>
