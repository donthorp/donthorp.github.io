  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was minding my own business this morning, when I get the call. Using my normal trick, a very quiet, sharp &#8216;hello&#8217; to detect predictive dialers from numbers I don&#8217;t recognize, I was expecting the normal lightning fast sales pitch. Instead &#8230;</p>


<blockquote><p>
REP: Good morning sir, is this Don Thorp?</p>
<p>ME: Yes. How may I help you. (Sometimes I do try to be polite)</p>
<p>REP: This is <a href="www.charter.com/" target="_blank">Charter Communications</a> and we think we may have misconfigured your cable service. Please tune to channel 50 and let me know if you have clear reception.
</p></blockquote>


<p>Thinking to myself, &#8220;ok &#8216;maybe&#8217; they&#8217;re being proactive&#8221;, I hunt for the remote (I&#8217;m in my office, if you could see my office, you would understand this is not undertaken lightly) and tune to channel 50.</p>


<blockquote><p>
ME: It&#8217;s static.</p>
<p>REP: Good, that tells me that you have our limited basic service. <span style="font-weight: bold">I can upgrade you today</span> to our expanded basic cable for only $15.00 a month. Would &#8230;</p>
<p>ME: Ma&#8217;am, I don&#8217;t &#8230;</p>
<p>REP: You would get The Discover Channel, &#8230;</p>
<p>ME: Ma&#8217;am, I have <a href="www.directv.com" target="_blank">DirectTV</a> for that, I only want &#8230;</p>
<p>REP: Sir&#8230; (stopped listening)</p>
<p>ME: Have a nice day ma&#8217;am, thank you (click)
</p></blockquote>


<p>I have to hand it to them. By pretending that they&#8217;ve messed up my service, she was able to get me <span style="text-style">involved</span> in the sales process. Sleezy, but effective in getting my attention.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During the middle of last week, a person I follow on <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jackstevison" target="_blank">Jack Stevison</a>, published his recipe for <a href="http://www.jackstevison.com/weblog/?p=190" target="_blank">Ten-Hour Beef</a>. I&#8217;m not much of a beef person anymore, so I decided to see if I could adapt it to pork.<br />
<img src="/content/uploads/2008/05/bbq_tenn.jpg" alt="Bottle of sauce" title="Barbecue Sauce Photo" width="185" height="183" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-88" style="float:right" /></p>


<h2>The Recipe</h2>


<p>1 Pork roast (5 lbs)<br />
2 Purple onions<br />
4 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serrano_pepper" target="_blank">Serrano peppers</a><br />
1 Bottle <a href="http://www.guinness.com/templates/GenericTemplate.aspx?NRMODE=Published&NRNODEGUID=%7bF4BC94ED-2A9B-405A-810C-18E445BFA13F%7d&NRORIGINALURL=%2fus_en%2fbeer%2fextraStout%2f&NRCACHEHINT=Guest&allowAccess=4r7a6h&refUrl=http%3a%2f%2fwww.guinness.com%2ftemplates%2fGenericTemplate.aspx%3fNRMODE%3dPublished%26NRNODEGUID%3d%257bF4BC94ED-2A9B-405A-810C-18E445BFA13F%257d%26NRORIGINALURL%3d%252fus_en%252fbeer%252fextraStout%252f%26NRCACHEHINT%3dGuest&RhLanguage=en-us&RhFlashEnabled=0&RhCountry=US&RhYear=1963&RhRemDetails=True&RhReferer=landingpage.guinness.com&gatewayStatusCode=10&me=hwq2oq55yijh3b3hzmdxrz45" target="_blank">Guinness Extra Stout</a><br />
2 Bottles <a href="http://www.jackdanielssauces.com/bbq/bbq_products.aspx" target="_blank">Jack Daniel&#8217;sÂ® Hickory Brown Sugar Barbecue Sauce</a></p>


<p>Also needed: Salt, Pepper, Garlic,  and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcestershire_sauce" target="_blank">Worcestershire Sauce</a></p>


<p>Trim excess fat off of the roast and slice into 3/8 strips. De-seed and slice the peppers into thin strips. Slice the onions and place half of them and half of the peppers on the bottom of the crock pot. Layer the pork slices on top of the onions and then cover with the remaining onions and peppers. Pour the Guinness and one bottle of the Jack Daniel&#8217;s sauce over the top. Cover and cook on high (6 hour setting on my crock pot) for 1.5 to 2 hours. </p>


<p>After the first two hours, stir gently to move things around and reduce the heat to low (8 hour setting). I stirred every hour for the next 7 hours. At this point pork should be tender and can be pulled apart with a fork, but does not disintegrate on touch. </p>


<p>This part came as a tip from my brother <a href="http://twitter.com/jmthorp" target="_blank">Michael</a>.</p>


<p>Pre-heat the oven to 375. While it&#8217;s heating, lightly oil a cookie sheet, then transfer the solid materials with a slotted spoon from the crock pot to the cookie sheet. Using about half of the other bottle of barbecue sauce, cover the meat with a light (~1/16 inch to 1/8 inch) layer of sauce. I used a brush to make sure things were covered evenly. Once the oven is heated, place the cookie sheet in the oven and cook uncovered for an additional 15-25 minutes. </p>


<p>Take the sheet out of the oven and gently pull the pork apart with two forks. Mix lightly to spread the sauce and serve. </p>


<p>You may want to save some of the liquid from the crock pot to store with leftovers to keep it moist when re-heated.</p>

I&#8217;m going to be galleries up to smugmug, and probably putting post graphics locally. This is going to be a little painful, mostly for me.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m too swamped to actual learn <a href="http://git.or.cz/" target="_blank">Git</a> at the moment, but I&#8217;m not going to let that stop me from claiming <a href="http://github.com/donthorp" target="_blank">my name</a> at <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>


<blockquote><p>
What is it?</p>
<p>Not only is Git the new hotness, it&#8217;s a fast, efficient, distributed version control system ideal for the collaborative development of software.</p>
<p>GitHub is the easiest (and prettiest) way to participate in that collaboration: fork projects, send pull requests, monitor development, all with ease. </p>
<p>- from the github main page
</p></blockquote>


<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a> for Git provides a good overview of the tool. </p>


<p>There are some interesting features and solutions in Git, but to me I don&#8217;t see a compelling reason to leave <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_blank">Subversion</a> just yet. It took a long time for Subversion to bake before it was well integrated into various toolsets and worked well across many platforms. I don&#8217;t have the luxury to not use many OSs, so I think it may be a while before Git is viable on Linux, Windows, and OS X and works with the tools I like.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have to admit, I was part of the problem, but it is very hard to resist coming to the aid of another parent when challenged by a teenager. I woke up this morning and saw this tweet which I&#8217;ve edited to remove the actual phone number.</p>


<blockquote><p>
<span style="color:blue">T+0h</span> <a href="http://twitter.com/leolaporte" target="_blank">leolaporte</a> My son Hank doesn&#8217;t believe I have so many followers. He says text him if you follow me here. 707 XXX-YYYY. Let&#8217;s see how many msgs he gets.
</p></blockquote>


<p>Not long after, this tweet appeared.</p>


<blockquote><p>
<span style="color:blue">T+0h</span> <a href="http://twitter.com/leolaporte" target="_blank">leolaporte</a>  OK that was a really bad idea. ;-)
</p></blockquote>


<p>I woke up in this period and couldn&#8217;t help but send my own text message to poor Hank. Telling him in fact that I did follow his dad on twitter. </p>


<p>Several hours later.</p>


<blockquote><p>
<span style="color:blue">T+10h</span> <a href="http://twitter.com/leolaporte" target="_blank">leolaporte</a> Boy it sure is hard deleting old tweets. Pownce and Jaiku delete them right away. Guess Hank&#8217;s phone will be unusable today.
</p></blockquote>


<p>The damage assessment will come.</p>


<blockquote><p>
<span style="color:blue">T+11h</span> <a href="http://twitter.com/leolaporte" target="_blank">leolaporte</a> I won&#8217;t know the total number of text messages Hank received until I get the bill, but it was in the thousands. He had to turn off the phone
</p></blockquote>


<p>And finally,</p>


<blockquote><p>
<span style="color:blue">T+11h</span> <a href="http://twitter.com/leolaporte" target="_blank">leolaporte</a> I DDoSed my own son.
</p></blockquote>


<p>While it may be a little extreme you can&#8217;t help but cheer just a little. How many times are parents challenged with no real way to prove a child wrong. Will it prevent Hank from challenging Dad in the future, probably not, he is a teenager after all. Will it make him think twice, just maybe.</p>


<p>Oh and the score in the title, the number of <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> users following Leo that had the opportunity to send a nice encouraging text to Hank.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;ve decided to sell the boat. There are several reason for the decision</p>


<ol>
<li>The closest lake has been too low, ramps closed</li>
<li>The closest lake has been too high, ramps closed</li>
<li>The slip fees at the closest marina are outrageous ~ $4000 per year which means I wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about the ramps.</li>
<li>Alex is headed off to school and we&#8217;re trying to get rid of all payments</li>
</ol>


<p>We&#8217;ve had a lot of good times on the boat both at home and away. My favorite trip was a week in Branson, MO. I was able to go out on a whim because it was in a slip a short walk from the condo.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every once in a while, you have one of âthose daysâ. April 10, 2008 was one of those days.  </p>


<p>The day started around 3:40am when a wall of wind and water hit the house. Tornados are not uncommon so I do feel an obligation to check for them which weather like this happens. Confident that we werenât about to land in the Oz, I crawled back in bed to enjoy the storm. I really do like sleeping when itâs raining.</p>


<p> Five minutes later, Iâm awakened by the crickets of the computer age, the UPS on battery. Some demented person must have wasted a good part of their life to come up with that sound. Although, itâs not quite as bad as the chirp from a smoke alarm with a dying battery. After 15 minutes with no power, I crawl out of bed and successfully shut everything down. Afraid I might oversleep, I grab my mobile, set the alarm, and crawl back into bed. </p>


<p>Of course, I canât fall back asleep. After locating a flashlight I spent 10 minutes locating the number for <a href="http://www.txu.com" target="_blank">TXU</a>âs power outage hotline. Keying it in my phone informs me that the number had been previously saved. I put it there to save myself some time after the last power outage. I call the hotline and report it, the automated attendant happily informs me that they have no idea when the power will be restored. I flop back in bed. </p>


<p>The mobile alarm functions as expected and I wake to the silence of the power impaired. At least there was hot water in the tank so we were able to clean up a bit. I had to figure out how to shave with limited lighting. I would say it was like camping, but honestly, who shaves on a camping trip. I would have blown it off, but I had to interview someone at the office today. On the positive side, the blood loss was kept to a minimum. Oh, and checking with TXU, still no word on when the power would be restored.</p>


<p><img src="/content/uploads/2008/05/american.jpg" alt="Photo of american airlines airplane tails" title="american" width="175" height="175" class="size-medium wp-image-81" style="float:left" /> You would think that would be enough for today, but no. I forgot to mention that Alex and I were headed to <a href="http://www.american.edu" target="_blank">American University</a> tonight. Given that we live in the Dallas area, <a href="http://www.aa.com" target="_blank">American Airlines</a> is the easiest carrier to use for most flights. Guess who <a href="http://tailrank.com/5656923/American-cancels-more-than-1-000-flights" target="_blank">&quot;forgot&quot; to inspect their planes</a>. Checking the website all morning the flight showed as on time. I went to lunch thinking weâre still going, come back and right before I race home, find out itâs been canceled.</p>


<p>To see if I can salvage the trip, I immediately try to get an agent. After sitting on hold for 15 minutes or so I actually get a live person, who then takes 20 minutes to tell me that there are not flights. I ask her to please schedule us for the same trip next week. Of course she says, let me put you on hold, where I sit for 15 minutes and then get disconnected. In the middle of this Alex gets to the house where he discovers that the garage door wonât open and he doesnât have his house key. So I call American back, on my mobile this time and start driving home.</p>


<p>After 25 minutes I get another agent who is able to successfully reschedule us for the next week in only 20 minutes, with out loosing me when she had to put me on hold. A few minutes later I reach the house and let Alex in and then start trying to deal with the hotel and cars. Let me just say, dealing with the <a href="http://www.Expedia.com" target="_blank">Expedia</a> rep was fast, efficient, and painless. Oh, yes the power was on, It only took them 12 hours.</p>


<p>Relieved, I decided to check <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> only to discover that a good friend was having a crisis, she couldnât decide what color to paint her toenails. Thinking I could help I suggested maroon and white, apparently <a href="http://www.ou.edu/web/home.html" target="_blank">OU</a>âs colors are crimson and cream, I had to apologize profusely, and now I know there is a difference. Oh and she chose cotton candy to celebrate Spring.</p>


<p>Finally, I didnât forget to wish my mother a Happy Birthday. Given the rest of the day, I consider that a minor miracle.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m always amazed at their creativity and ability to work on a shoestring. Oh, and Alex stars as &#8220;Vladimir&#8221;, he&#8217;s critical to the film.</p>

<p>For the rest of you, <a href="http://www.zefrank.com" target="_blank">zefrank</a> wrote a post entitled  <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/zesblog/archives/2008/03/colorwar_2008.html" target="_blank">&quot;colorwar 2008&quot;</a> where he mused.</p>


<blockquote><p>
We used to play color wars at summer camp. Near the end of the year the entire camp would split up into colors, red, green, black, blue, etc&#8230; and compete in a series of events: tug of war, egg toss, basketball - sort of like the movie Meatballs, except all within the same camp.</p>
<p>During the summer we were divided into discreet units, older kids here, younger kids there, Hiawathans by the lake Tawasenthans by the ropes course, etc&#8230; But when it came time for color wars you had no idea who would be on your team. It was a release, and it was viciously fun.</p>
<p>So, for a while I&#8217;ve been thinking about how a color war might look online.

<blockquote><p>If this isnât boredom, I donât know what is, but at least it gives us something to do.</p></blockquote>


<p>While I&#8217;m not sure how this is going to play out, and I&#8217;m probably too busy anyway, I decided to join and and see what the fun might be. </p>


<p>Twitter is a very interesting place.</p>
