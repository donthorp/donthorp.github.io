<p><img src="http://www.apc.com/resource/images/products/200/53547150-5056-9170-D3E8E2F20E9D31A7_f_h_200x100.jpg" style="float: left" />I was touting the wonders of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/" target="_blank">iPod Touch</a> to a friend, when he mentioned that he wouldn't buy one due to the lack of a replaceable battery. I originally thought he was worried about the end of life issue. The real issue is what do you do with a small child when the video device runs out of power at 30,000 feet. Enter the external USB battery pack.</p>
<p>My current "go to solution" is the <a href="http://www.apc.com/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=UPB10" target="_blank">APC Mobile Power Pack, 10 Wh (UPB10) unit</a> from <a href="http://www.apc.com" target="_blank">APC</a>. Surprisingly, it gets used for my phone much more than for my iPods.</p>
<p>Looking through APC's <a href="http://www.apc.com/products/family/index.cfm?id=314" target="_blank">Universal Mobile Device Batteries</a> product list, I saw a AAA battery powered unit the <a href="" _target="_blank"> APC USB Battery Extender (UPBX)</a>. This might be a good device to have around when you won't have power for charging the UPB10.</p>
