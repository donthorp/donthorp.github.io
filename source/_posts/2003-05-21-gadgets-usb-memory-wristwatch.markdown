They don't provide measurements that I can find, but the <a href="http://www.laks.com" target="_blank">LAKS USB Memory</a> wristwatch looks pretty cool.</p>
<p>
It works on Windows, Linux, and Mac. That implies that it's driverless. If you are really adventurous, you can order them customized (minimum order 100). The 128MB version is 93 USD.</p>
