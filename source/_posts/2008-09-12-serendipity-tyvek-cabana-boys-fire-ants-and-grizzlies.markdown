<p>Some days it all comes together like a Seinfeld episode; you don't know why your seeing what you're seeing, but you hope it leads somewhere. Today was one of those days on <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. It started innocently with a single tweet and ended up with me laughing uncontrollably. Maybe it's because it was Friday or possibly because I like slapstick humor, or most probably I'm a little further off the beaten path than I think. Anyway ...</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/Natallini" target="_blank">@Natallini</a> was putting off mowing the yard. Feeling all considerate, it is a Friday after all I, suggested a Tyvek suit or a cabana boy.</p>
<p><img src="/content/uploads/2008/09/tweeta01.png" alt="Dear, I need to mow the grass and don&#039;t feel like getting all yucky." title="tweeta01" width="283" height="64" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-112" /></p>
<p><a href='/content/uploads/2008/09/tweeta02.png' style='margin-left: 20px;'><img src="/content/uploads/2008/09/tweeta02.png" alt="Mow the yard w/o getting yucky get a tyvek suit or maybe you just need a cabana boy." title="tweeta02" width="283" height="84" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-113" /></a></p>
<table width="300px" style='background-color: #EEEEEE; padding: 5px; margin-left: 25px'>
<tr>
<td>
<p>If she just wanted to stay clean, then the suit should work great.</p>
</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>With a handsome cabana boy to work the mower, she could sit on the porch and have her favorite beverage.</p>

</table>
<p><br/><br />
Then she was attacked in her own home, by vicious little creatures.</p>
<p><a href='/content/uploads/2008/09/tweetb01.png'><img src="/content/uploads/2008/09/tweetb01.png" alt="Just got attacked by a fire ant in my office so pissed at these damn ants. It is on!" title="tweetb01" width="283" height="72" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-114" /></a></p>
<p><img src="/content/uploads/2008/09/fireant.jpg" alt="Fireant" title="fireant" width="75" height="71" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-110" style='float: right; margin-left: 10px;'/> For those of you fortunate enough to have never encountered the painful little creatures, count yourself lucky. The rest of you understand the primitive need to squish them all. If you'd like to know more about fire ants check out the Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_ant" target="_blank">Fire Ants</a> If you'd like to see them in action, there is a short video below.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Then we had a slight burst of misunderstanding between me <a href="http://twitter.com/donthorp" target="_blank">@donthorp</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/Natallini" target="_blank">@Natallini</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/eeUS" target="_blank">@eeUS</a></p>

<p>And then the Serendipitous tweet.</p>
<p><img src="/content/uploads/2008/09/tweetc01.png" alt="" title="tweetc01" width="283" height="96" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-120" /></p>
<p>Trust me we're getting there. My first thought, obviously, was <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>. Surely someone out there has fire ant proof suits; but sadly, I couldn't find one. I did find a patent entitled <a href="http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2003/0166372.html" target="_blank">Insect resistant geotextile</a>. For the very curious among you it's actually interesting how they tested for insect resistance, so give it a quick scan. The connection to this story is provided in the following quote.</p>
<blockquote style="background-color: #FFFFCC; padding-right: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 5px;"><p>
EXAMPLE I</p>
<p>[0034] An extruded nonwoven, such as TyvekÂ® was used to form a bag which was sealed to prevent the ants escape. The ants penetrated the extruded nonwoven within two (2) hours.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Although it only gives her a two hour window to escape, that should be sufficient if she also tapes the cuffs. </p>
<p>Now you're wondering why Grizzlies. Occasionally we're granted a Google gift during a search that provides fodder for posts such as this. I originally searched for <i>ant proof suit</i>. Lost in the search euphoria, I didn't save the set of keywords brought me to this, but here is the video that brought the laughter.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<div align="center">
<object ><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Q3CzYw5-qdA&rel=0&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Q3CzYw5-qdA&rel=0&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" ></embed></object>
</div>
<p><br/><br />
There is just something about the testing of that grizzly proof suit that brought me to tears. My first thought was, "That's a whole lot of Mondays". </p>
<p>Some of you may have recognized the source immediately, but I had to research to discover that the footage comes from a movie, available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Project-Grizzly-Troy-Hurtubise/dp/B0009E32CK" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, entitled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Grizzly" target="_blank">Project Grizzly</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Hurtubise" target="_blank">Troy Hurtubise</a>. It documents "Hurtubise's diligent work to improve his homemade "grizzly-proof" suit of armour, his efforts to test its resilience, and his forays into the Rockies to track down the grizzlies he dreams of meeting."</p>
<p>I really don't know if the grizzly suit is fire ant proof or not, but I'm convinced that the testing of the suit for use with fire ants would provide hours of painful video.</p>
