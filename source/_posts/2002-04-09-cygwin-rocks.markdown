Ok, normally, I never use the work "Rocks" in a sentence unless I'm telling a bunch of kids to stop throwing them, but it this case I made an exception. In general, cygwin (you can find it at <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin" target="_blank">http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin</a>) provides a unix type environment under windows. Which by itself, is a major plus.</p>
<p>
What prompted today's outburst was a simple question I asked..."I wonder if it is possible to run sshd under Win2K/XP"? The simple answer is <b>YES</b>. Using google, I found this link <a href="http://www-co.ch.cam.ac.uk/facilities/misc/cygwin.html" target="_blank">http://www-co.ch.cam.ac.uk/facilities/misc/cygwin.html</a> which gives a quick walk through of how to do it. Now I can access my box from the network using command line tools over a secure channel instead of relying on GUI tools. Once again, the open source movement comes through.</p>
