<p><a href="http://donthorp.smugmug.com/gallery/7149761_axaYq" class="noicon" target="_blank" style="float: right; padding-left:10px; padding-bottom: 10px;"><img src="http://donthorp.smugmug.com/photos/458754492_kbWud-S.jpg" border="no"/></a> I've create a <a href="http://donthorp.smugmug.com/gallery/7149761_axaYq" target="_blank">gallery</a> of photos from the remodel of Allison's bedroom. She wanted her walls red with a dark wood floor. Given the experience we had with renovating my office in 2008, we were confident we could crank out most of the work over the MLK holiday weekend. As of this post we've completed everything except the baseboard and moving her in.</p>
<p>We ripped out the 13+ year old carpet and replaced it with a floating bamboo floor. The walls were painted with a dark brown (Behr Bison Brown) and then covered the brown with red (Behr Daredevil). The eggshell finish for the red gives it a glazed look and provides for an interesting finish over the brown. The original baseboard was repainted and replaced and shoe molding will be added to cover any gaps from contraction.</p>
<p>I hope to post a howto in the future, now that we've installed two floating floors using this bamboo flooring, </p>
