<h3>Job Search 2001 - Ends!</h3>
<p>
					It's official, I've faxed the form back to Jody and I'm now off the market.<br />
					Starting May 14th, I'll be working for <a href="http://www.chipdata.com"><br />
					ChipData</a> located in Richardson, TX. It took a little over a month,<br />
					but I'm pleased with the results. Guess I'll have to start getting up<br />
					early again.
