<p>
Today was the official launch of <a href="http://www.credant.com" target="_blank">Credant Technologies</a>.<br />
For those of you who don't know, this is the company I went to work for after leaving the last one.<br />
The "coming out" press release is entitled <a href="http://www.credant.com/newsMobileEnterprises.html" target="_blank">CREDANT TECHNOLOGIES (tm) First to Deliver Trusted Computing for Mobile Enterprises</a>.</p>
<p>
So for those of you have been wondering what the heck I'm working on, <strong>some</strong> information is now available.</p>
