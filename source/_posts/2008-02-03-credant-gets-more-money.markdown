<p>I've worked at my &quot;day job&quot;, <a href="http://www.credant.com" target"_blank">CREDANT Technologies, Inc</a>, for almost six years now. I happened to run across an article in the <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/" target="_blank">Dallas Business Journal</a> and found out that <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/2008/01/28/newscolumn4.html?b=1201496400^1581658" target="_blank">Credant investors ante up $5M in 'top-off' funding round</a>. Not completely surprised, but I definitely wasn't expecting it.</p>
