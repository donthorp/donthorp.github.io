<p>It's been ages since I've posted anything to the blog on my site, because I just got fed up with the data entry. Today, on a whim, I decided to see how much effort it would be to take my old blog from <a href="http://www.donthorp.net">www.donthorp.net</a> and move it to a wordpress blog.</p>
<p>The export from Moveable Type and import into WordPress went smoothly. It took me a moment to figure out why my posts weren't showing up. It's because a WordPress import brings the articles in as drafts. Once I figured that out, I went through and published each post.</p>
<p>It wasn't completely flawless, because I still need to fix up some URLs that used root relative URLs from my original site (e.g. /gallery instead of http://www.donthorp.net/gallery). I may also install WordPress on my system and then it'll be less of an issue.</p>
