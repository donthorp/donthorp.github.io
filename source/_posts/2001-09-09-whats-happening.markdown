<p>
					Most of my time is being spent right now at work. We are trying to get<br />
					a product out the door on a really tight schedule. That is preventing<br />
					me from doing much of anything on the site right now, but I have finally<br />
					captured the last image from the flower bed project and will work to<br />
					get them online as soon as I can.

<h3>Frosted Hair Is In</h3>
<p>
					My son has been begging to get his hair frosted so we finally gave in,<br />
					and Laura frosted it tonight. I snapped some photos for posterity. It<br />
					also really highlight the limits of the little Intel ProShare camera<br />
					that I snapped the pics with.
