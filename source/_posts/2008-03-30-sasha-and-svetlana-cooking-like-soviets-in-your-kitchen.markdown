<p>My daughter and her friend Elana have alter egos -- Sasha and Svetlana. For weeks they've been talking about recording videos about their "adventures". For some reason, tonight was the night for filming episode 1, "Sasha and Svetlana - Cooking Like Soviets in Your Kitchen". </p>

<p>I'm always amazed at their creativity and ability to work on a shoestring. Oh, and Alex stars as "Vladimir", he's critical to the film.</p>
