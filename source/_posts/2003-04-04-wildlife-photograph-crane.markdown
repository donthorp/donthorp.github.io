<p><a href="/gallery/v/outdoors/animals/crane/IMG_3587.jpg.html"><img src="/gallery/d/3123-2/IMG_3587.jpg" align="right" border="0" /></a>Spring must be here. Animals are posing all over the place. This crane was fishing in a ditch after a thunderstorm. It has been in the area for quite some time, but I never seemed to have my camera ready.</p>
<p>I had to make a quick trip up to the school, saw it, came home to get the camera and found him still there. Made for a fun day.</p>
