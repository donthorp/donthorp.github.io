<p><img src="/content/uploads/2009/02/img_1979-version-2-200x150.jpg" alt="Piggie in a Blanket" title="img_1979-version-2-200x150" width="200" height="150" class="size-full wp-image-301" style="float:left; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px"/> Today I attempted to make piggies in a blanket. The recipe is simple.</p>
<blockquote><p>
1 or more tubes of biscuits<br />
1 little smokie per biscuit<br />
Use cooking times and temperature from biscuit packaging.</p>
<p>Lightly grease a cookie sheet. Using one sausage per biscuit, wrap the smokie snuggly with a biscuit and place on the cookie sheet.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently, I failed the "wrap smokie snuggly" part on some of the "Piggies in a Blanket" and ended up with new recipe which I've called "Piggies In and On a Blanket". Next time I will try wetting the edge of the biscuit so that it stays together, or roll the biscuit until it appears seamless.</p>
