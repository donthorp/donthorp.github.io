<h3>Dictionary of Computer Terms</h3>
<p>While researching a project for work, I needed to get definitions of some computer terms. Not being comfortable with my connotation of the terms, I used <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> to search for other definitions.</p>
<p>After spending a fair amount of time googling, I ran across this gem: <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/" target="_blank">whatis?com</a>.<br />
According to whatis, it contains "Definitions for thousands of the most current IT-related words". Most importantly, it provided the definitions of the terms I was trying to clarify.</p>
