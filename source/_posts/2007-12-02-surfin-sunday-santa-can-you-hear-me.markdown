<p>Every once in a while I hop on that rabbit trail known as "the net". Today's trail started on <a href="http://twitter.com/donthorp">twitter</a>. Seeing that I'm a fan of <a href="http://geekbrief.tv">Cali Lewis on GeekBrief.tv</a>,   I wondered who she follows. Nosing around, I decided that maybe I should add some more people to follow.</p>
<p>On a whim I put "trader" in the search box, a couple of squirrel revolutions later, and out pops <a href="https://twitter.com/tw/search/users?q=trade">a list</a> with a name I couldn't pass up -- <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingGoddess">TradingGoddess</a>. Jump to <a href="http://tradinggoddess.blogspot.com/">her blog</a>, spin the mouse wheel and out pops the gem below.</p>
