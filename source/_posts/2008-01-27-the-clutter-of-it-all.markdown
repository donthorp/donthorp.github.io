<p>I find the affect of clutter to be cyclical. Sometimes, when I know what I need to get done and I can be fully absorbed in the task, it has no affect. Other times, when I don't have a clear picture on what needs to be done, it really bothers me.</p>
<p>There are a ton of tasks to be done this time every year: taxes, new development projects, school activities, etc. All of them seem to slowly suck the life out of me. Oh, and don't forget winter is starting to lose it's grasp, so yard work is about to start calling too. It's enough to make you want to crawl back in bed and pull the covers up. </p>
<p>I wonder if hibernation would get us out of doing taxes and  bookwork?</p>
<p>On the bright side, today was the first day of the year that it's nice enough to put the top down on the car and let the sunshine help drive the winter blues away. Maybe a few more days of direct sunlight will allow the winter fog to lift and release the energy that I need to start knocking tasks off the list.</p>
<p>Update: Reading through my news feed I ran across this post <a href="http://zenhabits.net/2008/01/a-guide-to-cutting-back-when-you-feel-overwhelmed/" target="_blank">A Guide to Cutting Back When You Feel Overwhelmed</a> from <a href="http://zenhabits.net/" target="_blank">Zen Habits</a>.</p>
