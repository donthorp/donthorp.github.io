<p>A lot of experienced Twitter users <b>rely</b> on the one sided conversation feature to find <em>people worth following</em>. Seeing how people interact with others on twitter that I don't already follow have resulted in some of my best online friends. Many of which I've met in real life.</p>
<p>So, Twitter, if you want to have the default setting be this new feature, then go ahead. But don't take away one of the truly innovative features that have made the service what it is today. I'm not ready to stop discovering new interesting people, I want those one-sided replies. Otherwise, how am I suppose to expand my horizons and interact with people I've yet to meet.</p>
<div style="font-size: 130%; text-align: center">So <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23fixreplies">#fixreplies</a>, please!</div>

<h3>Post from Twitter</h3>
<h4><a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/05/small-settings-update.html#links" target="_blank">Small Settings Update</a></h4>
<p>We've updated the Notices section of Settings to better reflect how folks are using Twitter regarding replies. Based on usage patterns and feedback, we've learned most people want to see when someone they follow replies to another person they followâ€”it's a good way to stay in the loop. However, receiving one-sided fragments via replies sent to folks you don't follow in your timeline is undesirable. Today's update removes this undesirable and confusing option.</p>
<p>
Confused? That's understandable and exactly why we made the update.</p>
