<p>
					It has been a long time since I've been able to post anything. It is amazing<br />
					where your time goes once summer gets here. Over the weekend I spent WAY to<br />
					much time helping fix my youngest brother's computer. Not only did I have<br />
					to reinstall Win98 on it, the motherboard's keyboard port freaked out<br />
					requiring me to replace the motherboard. As<br />
					with most hardware based problems, this one ended up costing me 8+ hours on<br />
					Saturday.

<h3>Agenda VR3</h3>
<p>
					Ever since becoming addicted to using my Palm III, I've developed a stronger<br />
					interest in new handheld computing devices. I was an early<br />
					adopter of the Franklin eBookMan (<em>I'm still waiting for the MS Reader<br />
					software if anyone from Franklin is listening</em>) and still use it for<br />
					reading. It appears that one of the Linux contenders<br />
					<a href="http://www.agendacomputing.com/" target="blank">Agenda</a> is finally<br />
					getting a product out the door. A great review<br />
					<a href="http://linux.oreillynet.com/pub/a/linux/2001/05/18/agenda_pda.html?page=1" target="_blank">The Agenda VR3: Real Linux in a PDA</a>,<br />
					written by Chris Halsall, is available on the Linux Devcenter of the<br />
					O'Reilly Network. Not having played with one yet, this device sounds like it<br />
					might have longterm viability if the software quality can approach that of<br />
					the Palm platform.

<h3>Python</h3>
<p>
					I've been slowly adding to my Python skills everytime I get the need to<br />
					write a new script. It is still slow going, but I do feel like I'm getting<br />
					better. As with most languages, the difficulty is in learning the libraries<br />
					not the language. While putting a script together I ran across a great<br />
					tool provided by <a href="http://www.activestate.com" target="_blank">ActiveState</a>,<br />
					"<a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Python/Cookbook/" target="_blank"><br />
					The Python Cookbook</a>". I was able to quickly find a couple of helpful routines<br />
					to accelerate writing the script. It also looks like a place to pick up<br />
					hints on using classes and cross-platform Python.
