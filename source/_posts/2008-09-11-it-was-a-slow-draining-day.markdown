<p><img src="/content/uploads/2008/09/drano.jpg" alt="Picture of a Drano bottle" title="drano" width="74" height="137" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-105" />The shower has been draining slowly for a few days. On her way to work this morning, Laura called to remind me to pour <a href="http://www.drano.com/plumbing-problems/default.aspx" target="_blank">Drano</a> down the shower drain. Having a little extra energy this morning, I decided to go the extra mile and see if I could clean it by hand before using chemicals. That way, the Drano would be much more effective and have much less work to do. </p>

<p>I've wondered for years how the drain cover stays in place, but I never bothered to actually look. On close inspection there seemed to be four tabs holding it in place, so a little pressure and it popped right out. If you look closely, you'll see a little bump on the tab that helps keep it below the rim.</p>
<p>After successfully pulling the cover off, I peered into the drain and was greeted by a glob of stuff that honestly, was probably alive. Reaching in the drain, I SLOWLY pulled and pulled and pulled, until finally with a soft plop, an ENTIRE ponytail looking creature was resting peacefully on the shower floor. Thankfully, it didn't spring to life and attack.</p>
