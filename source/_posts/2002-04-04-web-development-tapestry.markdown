<p>
I discovered a good <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/home/thread.jsp?thread_id=12750" target="_blank">discussion</a> on Tapestry vs Struts at <a href="http://www.theserverside.com" target="_blank">The Server Side</a>. <a href="http://tapestry.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Tapestry 2.0</a> has just been released and is now available. I haven't had time to do a review, but it does look like the component approach of Tapestry has some real benefits.</p>
