					What a weekend. Besides soccer and all of that stuff, the biggest project was Alex's<br />
					&quot;Creativity Project&quot;. We spent a good part of the weekend building a<br />
					lighthouse night light, but it turned out well. Of course it's due tomorrow, but there<br />
					are just a few minor touches that we've been adding. I help with soldering and<br />
					cutting of some of the materials, but he did most of it himself. I've got some<br />
					digital photos, but the quality is really bad. I may post them later.
