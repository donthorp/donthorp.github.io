<p>I'm too swamped to actual learn <a href="http://git.or.cz/" target="_blank">Git</a> at the moment, but I'm not going to let that stop me from claiming <a href="http://github.com/donthorp" target="_blank">my name</a> at <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
What is it?</p>
<p>Not only is Git the new hotness, it's a fast, efficient, distributed version control system ideal for the collaborative development of software.</p>
<p>GitHub is the easiest (and prettiest) way to participate in that collaboration: fork projects, send pull requests, monitor development, all with ease. </p>
<p>- from the github main page

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)" target="_blank">Wikipedia page</a> for Git provides a good overview of the tool. </p>
<p>There are some interesting features and solutions in Git, but to me I don't see a compelling reason to leave <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_blank">Subversion</a> just yet. It took a long time for Subversion to bake before it was well integrated into various toolsets and worked well across many platforms. I don't have the luxury to not use many OSs, so I think it may be a while before Git is viable on Linux, Windows, and OS X and works with the tools I like.</p>
