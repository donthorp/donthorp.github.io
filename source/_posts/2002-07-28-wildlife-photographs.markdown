<p>
I have several new critters added to the <a href="http://www.donthorp.net/gallery/outdoors">Animals</a> album.<br />
There are a few pictures of a very small anole, several pictures of a mole that we found<br />
swimming in our pool, and one of a snake that I saw in the bushes at my mother's house.</p>
