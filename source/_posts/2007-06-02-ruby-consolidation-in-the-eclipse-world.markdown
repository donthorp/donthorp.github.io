<p>Apparently I've been a little out of touch. I've been happily using <a href="http://rubyeclipse.sourceforge.net/">RDT</a> with Eclipse and hadn't needed to change. While catching up on some reading, I ran across this press release &quot;<a href="http://www.aptana.org/rdt.html">Aptana to Merge RadRails and RDT into its Ajax-focused IDE</a>&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.aptana.org/images/aptana_ide.gif" alt="Aptana Logo" style="padding-right:5px;float:left;"><a href="http://www.aptana.org/">Aptana</a> bills itself as "the leading Interactive Development Environment (IDE) for Web 2.0 and Ajax development". I took a moment and watched their screen cast and have to say it looks like a good start. As soon as I need to update my IDE again, I'll look at switching over. For now, I'm going to keep pluging away with my current version.</p>
