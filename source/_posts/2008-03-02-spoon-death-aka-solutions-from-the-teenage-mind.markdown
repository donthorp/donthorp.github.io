<p><img src="/content/uploads/2008/05/spoons.jpg" alt="Pile of mangled spoons" title="spoons" width="250" height="211" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-82" style="float:right" /> Authors on the Net don't always consider their readership. For instance, consider the problem of puffy eyes or bags under the eyes. In the modern world what do we do? Google of course. Who is allowed to use Google? Everyone, including teenagers.</p>
<p>Take a moment to read the following excerpt found during my quest to answer the question, "What the hell was she thinking?".</p>
<blockquote><p>
Here are some instructions to reduce eye puffiness: </p>
<p>The puffiness of the eyes can be reduced with a glass of ice water and<br />
four stainless steel spoons.</p>
<p>“Chill the spoons in the water and then place one over each eye. When<br />
the spoons become warm, switch them with the others chilling in the<br />
glass of water. Keep switching until you see improvement.” </p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, the author didn't consider the improvisation and lack of forethought that is the hallmark of a teenage mind. For example the following questions should have probably been asked.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is an alternative place to cool spoons?</li>
<li>Does a teenager always remember that they started something?</li>
<li>Does a teenager think, is this a good idea?</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, why bother with a glass out of the cabinet, filling it with ice, water, and worry about wet spoons, when you can simply drop them in the ice maker? </p>
<p>What could go wrong, it's not moving now, how could the spoons cause a problem? </p>
<p>Imagine the dialog.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Parent:</b> Honey, how long have the spoons been in the ice maker? </li>
<li><b>Teenager:</b> Ice maker? Who would put spoons in the ice maker? </li>
</ul>
<p>The funny thing is, the ice maker functioned for a very long time with spoons wrapped around in various places. Just as surprising is that an ice maker has enough torque to bend spoons and not just jam. </p>
<p>I discovered this "experiment" yesterday when we replaced our aging refrigerator with a one year old unit we bought from a friend. I took the ice bin outside and dumped it in the flower bed and was a little startled when I heard metallic clinking as the ice hit the ground.</p>
<p>So, to all your helpful Heloise's out there, please consider that teenagers do roam the Net and their solution may just surprise you.</p>
