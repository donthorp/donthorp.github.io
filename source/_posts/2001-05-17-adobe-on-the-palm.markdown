					Well, not a lot has happened to write about, but John found a that<br />
					Adobe is finally taking the Palm seriously and has released a<br />
					beta of <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readerforpalm.html" target="_blank"><br />
					Acrobat Reader for the PalmOS</a>. I was really pumped up to see<br />
					it. I took a couple of seconds to download and install it and it really<br />
					does seem to work. Although, they recommend using Acrobat 5.0 to prepare the PDF<br />
					documents, the converter does work for some older documents.

					I did find out that a new book has been published by<br />
					<a href="http://www.newriders.com" target="_blank">New Riders</a> covering VIM. It was<br />
					written by Steve Oualline, the title is &quot;<br />
					<a href="http://http://www.newriders.com/books/title.cfm?isbn=0735710015" target="_blank"><br />
					Vi IMproved - Vim</a>&quot;. I'm finding that I'm needing to learn VIM the<br />
					more I work on *nix boxes. Since New Riders<br />
					is good about releasing quality books and it is pulling high marks on<br />
					<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735710015/o/qid=990152393/sr=8-1/ref=aps_sr_b_1_1/107-9207198-1168520" target="_blank">Amazon</a>,<br />
					I'm probably going to order it soon.
